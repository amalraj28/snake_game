# snake_game

The famous `Snake Game`, where a snake grows upon eating food and dies when it collides either with the walls or with it's own tail, is created using Python programming.

The user controls the snake using arrow keys and upon coming in contact with the food, they earn a point as well as the snake grows by one unit. The high score is updated in the `data.txt` file which ensures that high score is retained even after the game is turned off.

The program uses the concept of Object Oriented Programming(OOP) to create the various objects required for the game. Turtle library is used for GUI as well as the various objects, mainly the snake, food, scores, etc.
